# NoteBock
Note-taking and assignment organizing application

Created during a 24-hour hackathon at WSU.  Asks for input for semester info, then with a semester selected can add class information.
Will then populate a calender for said class, and selecting an individual day allows notes to be taken and assignment info to be input.  A
small window in the lower right will alert you to any upcoming assignments or events within the next week.
